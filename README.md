## hello ðŸ‘‹, i'm Leo ðŸ’»
I'm from Argentina and I'm a Machine Learning Engineer. Currently working as an ML Engineer using MLOps and practical Cloud AWS technologies.

I am a curious person in general. Besides programming, I like Electronics, Physics (Quantum Mechanics), Mathematics and Psychology. I also like to do physical activity, trekking and bicyclist bike.

I take time every day (outside normal business hours) to create things that excite me. I am currently doing a project where I combine two of my passions: MLOps with an ML model applied to Physical Activity, using data from my Garmin sports bracelet (Here is the reference to the repository under construction: [Garmin_MLOps](https://github.com/Leonardo1133/Garmin_MLOps)).  

## Skills
- SageMaker_Studio, Athena, PySpark, Lambda, S3, CodeCommit, EventBridge, CloudWatch, SSM_Parameter, SageMaker_Pipeline, etc.
- In my day to day I use technologies such as: SQL, Python, Pandas, Numpy, SK-Learn, Git, Bash, Linux, Docker, etc.
- I did my degree thesis on Image Filtering with Machine Learning in matlab. I participated in Mercadolibre in a Machine Learning project for Fraud Prevention.
